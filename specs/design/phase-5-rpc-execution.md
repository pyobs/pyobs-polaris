# Phase 5 — RPC execution

Status: implemented, closed.

`codec::valueToXml(WireValue, WireType)` (the encode half) writes directly
to a `QXmlStreamWriter` — schema-dependent, unlike decoding, because of the
int32-vs-float64 ambiguity on the wire. `executeMethod(fullJid,
methodName, params, CommandSchema)` builds the XEP-0009 RPC IQ
(`jabber:iq:rpc` envelope wrapping a `urn:pyobs:rpc:1` value payload — the
double-wrapping is real, don't flatten it), parses either a return value or
an RPC fault (`exceptionClass`/message) back. The debug panel sends every
param as `WireValue::null()` — acceptable since every real `IRoof`/
`IMotion` command's params are already optional; a real param-entry UI
would need the full `CommandSchema` (see `TODO.md`).
