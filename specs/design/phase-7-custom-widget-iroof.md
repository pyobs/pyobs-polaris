# Phase 7 — first custom widget: `IRoof`

Status: implemented, closed.

`widgets/RoofWidget.qml`: filters the module list for `IRoof`, embeds
`KeyValueCard` (Phase 4) for the module's `IMotion` state (matching
`RoofView.vue`'s own choice of which interface to render, kept for parity
even though `IRoof` has an equivalent state block on the wire), and adds
hand-designed "Open"/"Close"/"Stop" buttons wired through `executeMethod`
(Phase 5), each disabled while that module's command is in flight.
Gotcha: `pyobs-core`'s disco#info generation emits a full schema for every
interface a module implements, *including inherited ones* — a live `roof`
module lists `IRoof` as its own separate `<interface>` entry with the same
`init`/`park`/`stop_motion` commands and its own `state/IRoof/1` block
duplicated alongside `IMotion`'s, even though the Python `IRoof` class
itself declares nothing of its own (pure semantic marker). Confirmed
repeatedly across live testing, not assumed from the Python class
definition.
