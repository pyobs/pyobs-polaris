# Phase 3 — presence-driven module list

Status: implemented, closed.

Presence handler requires resource `pyobs` (matches `PYOBS_RESOURCE`);
`unavailable` removes the module, anything else triggers
`fetchModuleInfo`. **Roster presence probe on connect is required** —
without it, a client that connects after modules are already online never
learns about them (this bit the TS client once already). Module list is a
`QAbstractListModel`. Gotcha: test harnesses that die without an explicit
`disconnectFromServer()` leave stale XMPP sessions server-side, showing up
as extra `presenceReceived` noise from unrelated resources of the same
bare JID — always fully quit prior test sessions before trusting a
presence test.
